stress testing scenario in crew standby

---

### **1. Use Scenario-Based Testing**

* **Create hypothetical extreme scenarios** that have not happened before (e.g., 50% crew unavailability, 200% flight demand).
* These scenarios act as a “pseudo-ground truth” for stress testing.
* You **define what would be considered sufficient buffer** based on operational rules, expert judgment, or safety constraints.

**Example:**

* Suppose rules say no flight should go uncovered.
* If 150 flights are scheduled and 40% of crew are unavailable, calculate the minimum buffer needed using combinatorial / probabilistic modeling.
* This calculated number becomes your reference for evaluation.

---

### **2. Use Probabilistic Simulations**

* Run Monte Carlo simulations or stochastic models to simulate hundreds or thousands of possible outcomes under extreme stress.
* This creates a **distribution of needed standby crew** instead of a single historical number.
* Compare the predictor’s output to this distribution:

  * Is it within a reasonable percentile?
  * Does it cover, say, 95% of simulated scenarios?

### **3. Define Metrics for Evaluation**

Even without historical events, you can measure:

1. **Coverage Probability** – Fraction of simulated scenarios where the predicted buffer is sufficient.
2. **Expected Shortfall** – Average number of flights left uncovered if the predicted buffer is insufficient.
3. **Robustness / Sensitivity** – How much does the predicted buffer change if crew absence or demand varies slightly?
4. **Cost-Efficiency** – Compare predicted buffer size vs. simulated “required buffer” to estimate extra staffing cost.

### **4. Example Table for Stress Testing Without Historical Data**

| Scenario  | Flights | Crew Absence | Simulated Required Buffer | Predictor Output | Coverage Probability |
| --------- | ------- | ------------ | ------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| Extreme 1 | 150     | 40%          | 18                        | 15               | 85%                  |
| Extreme 2 | 200     | 50%          | 25                        | 22               | 90%                  |

✅ **Key Idea:** When no historical event exists, stress testing relies on **simulated or theoretically calculated “ground truth”** rather than actual past outcomes. This lets you evaluate whether your predictor is **robust and conservative enough** for extreme situations.

If you want, I can **create a small workflow diagram showing how to stress-test a standby crew buffer predictor without historical events** — it’s very intuitive visually. Do you want me to do that?
